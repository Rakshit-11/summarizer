## Features

- Tokenizes input text into sentences and words.
- Removes common stop words to focus on meaningful content.
- Creates a frequency distribution of words to identify important terms.
- Calculates sentence scores based on the frequency of important words.
- Extracts the top N sentences with the highest scores to form the summary.
